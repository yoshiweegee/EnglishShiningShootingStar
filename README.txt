This is the English patch for Shining Shooting Star by yoshimo!
Now you can understand what else Ami is talking about other than a party!


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Copy the "Story" folder to the same place your patched game is located. There should already be a folder named "Story" there, so your system might ask if you want to merge the folders. Say "Yes." If it also asks if you want to replace files, say "Yes" to this, too.

RECOMMENDED: I suggest that you right-click on "PSSSetting.INI" and click "Edit." This will open the file for editing. Change the number after "Size=" to "11". This will make the text smaller and fit in the game's text box.

2. Play the game!


TROUBLESHOOTING:

"The patch doesn't work!"
OR 
"The game crashes with the patch!"

 * Did you remember to copy the "Story" folder to the game's location? ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU COPIED IT TO THE RIGHT PLACE?

 * Did you patch the game with Polished Shooting Star RC3.2 or later? Earlier versions of this patch will not correctly work! If you have not patched your game with this patch, you need to! Refer to the forum post!

"The text is too large and goes outside of the text box!"

 * Did you reduce the font size? If you didn't, refer to the RECOMMENDED step!
